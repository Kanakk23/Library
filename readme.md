# Library System

This is a simple library system implemented in C++.
I have made tested this software on my macos, hopefull it is compatible with other systems as well. (If there is any issue in compatibility, I would suggest just modifing the compilation code might work.)

## Compilation

To compile the code, use the following command:

```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -o library_system main.cpp book_db.cpp user_db.cpp models/student.cpp models/faculty.cpp models/librarian.cpp models/user.cpp models/book.cpp
```

## Execution

To run the compiled program, use the following command:

```sh
./library_system
```
